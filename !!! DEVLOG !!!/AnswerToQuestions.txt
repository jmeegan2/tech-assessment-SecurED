1. What do you enjoy the most about software development?
A1 :
    There are multiple parts that I enjoy about software development. The most import one to me is that fact 
that I will be able to learn constantly throughout my career and there will never be a shortage of 
interesting technologies that I can become apart of. The second thing I enjoy most about software is 
its challenging and very fullfilling once you complete a hard task/assignment that seemed almost 
impossible in the beginning. The third thing I enjoy is the fact that there will always be new 
software created that will change the world and impact people in ways never thought of before.
There's also the obvious good career opportunities, good pay, not hard on the body, and many more. 

2. Describe your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations.
A2: 
    My ideal career progression would be graduating from college and landing a software development 
    position, I would prefer it be in the frontend or frontend related development since that is What
    I've been focusing on for the past year. I may work at other companies, maybe try to get into 
    a FAANG company. My ultimate goal would be to start my own company that is software related, truthfully
    I'm not quite sure what that would entail. I need to find a way to bring value to consumers that others
    are not already doing or do it better than the competition. So the ultimate goal is to start my own software
    development related company.
